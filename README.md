In this GitHub Repo, you will find the code we have written to analyze chronic absenteeism rates in North Carolina. Currently, there are three .RMD files.

The first is our "initial exploratory analysis." Here, we analyzed rates of chronic absenteeism among every subgroup (every gender, every ethnicity, for english as a second language learners, and for disabled students). This file is very long, and you don't need to read it to find the code we used for our story. This would be useful for someone trying to write a story about ANY of the other subgroups. 

The second file is our "disabled students & chronic absenteeism" .rmd. Here we found most of the key statistics and statistical information you will see in our story. Most of it is toward the top in our nutgraf.

The third file is our "mapping" file. Here we made two interactive maps. One shows the average rates of chronic absenteeism among disabled students in every school district, minus the Cherokee Nation, Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune. We also have a map that shows the range in percentage points in each school district. Essentially, you can see how big the gap is between a district's school with the lowest percentage of chronically absent disabled students and the highest percentage. 

The fourth file, "final questions" is where we calculated some leftover information (important nonetheless) that we realized we needed in our story as we were writing it. We made dataframes showing the "percentage point ranges" demonstrated in the mapping file. We found out which school districts had the widest and narrowest gaps and then used this link to look up the names of schools by providing their agency codes.
